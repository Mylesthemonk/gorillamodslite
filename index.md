There are *many more mods* to discover, and you'll find them in the **Downloads** category on the [GorillaTag Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/b2MhDBAzTv).

### Is modding the game safe?

Modding the game is allowed by the developers of Gorilla Tag, however keep in mind the following:

> The use of mods that interfere with gameplay inside public lobbies is forbidden by the developers and can result in a ban. Please keep mods contained to private lobbies. **Most gameplay-changing mods automatically disable joining public lobbies, but please be careful.**

### End Goal

This guide has the end goal of taking a completely unmodified Gorilla Tag installation from vanilla to modded with BepInEx (PC) or QuestLoader (Quest).
